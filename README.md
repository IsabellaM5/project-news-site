# News Site

In this project I've built a news site about a dear friend of mine; Alva (dog). 


## The problem

The main task was to build a news site with a responsive design containing one section with one big article and a grid section with a few other articles. The tools/techniques used for this project was HTML, CSS (general styling, flexbox, responsive design) and Javascript.

First I did a general sketch on paper of how I wanted the layout to look like on different devices. After that I started coding and began with the general layout for the mobile device first. With the basic HTML-structure in place I started adding styling and content, which I continuously adjusted throughout the whole project with the help of the dev tools in Chrome. In this process I also added the media query to be able to make the site responsive and look different on the three devices mobile, tablet and desktop.

If I had more time I would have tried to use CSS-grid instead of flexbox to solve the structure of the news articles. Also regarding my menu animation in mobile view, I would maybe change the animation to come from the top instead of right.
